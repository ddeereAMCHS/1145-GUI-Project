# GUI Project

## Due: Fri 5/17 at the end of class

- Create a game using a GUI
- This can be a game that already exists or a game you make up
- Your game (regardless of if it already exists or not) must be approved by me before you start
- I reserve the right to require you to add additional features if your game is too simple
- If you need image files or word lists, go to https://github.com/ddeereAMCHS/Tools and see if I have what you need
- When you are done, uncomment the print statement in `Done.java`
